## 🎯 Objective

This project is meant to:

- Visualize how upload frequency and content length influence channel growth.
- Model engagement trends based on minimal but strategic uploads.
- Provide a beginner-friendly base for creators or analysts to build YouTube growth prediction tools.

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Engagement tends to increase with longer videos (7–10 minutes).
- Fewer, higher-quality uploads can still lead to consistent subscriber gains.
- View spikes correlate with both video quantity and watch duration.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone or fork the repository.
2. Open the CSV file in Excel, Python, or R.
3. Use visualization tools (e.g. Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore trends.
4. Modify the data or simulate your own growth patterns.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add a Jupyter Notebook for visualizing trends 📈
- Connect to YouTube API for real-world comparisons 🔗
- Analyze Casey Neistat's actual data via public tools like [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com)
